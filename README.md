# Daily Code 

## Practice in data structures, algorithms, and code challenges

Welcome! This repo serves as a centralized location for holding my code challenges from external sites (such as Code Wars). Is showcases my committment to continued learning post-bootcamp at Code Fellows, where I earned a certificate in Advanced Javascript in August 2020. This particular repo focuses on whiteboard type questions and code challenges. Soon, there will be links to my home-projects as well.
