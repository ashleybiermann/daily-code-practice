## Problem Domain

- Write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed. 'y' is not a vowel for this domain.

## Example

- For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

## Solution

- Use regex and string replace method to find vowels and replace them with ''.

## Big O

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## Test Considerations

- strings of varied lengths, over the course of one to many lines
